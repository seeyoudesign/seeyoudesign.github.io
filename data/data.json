He was born in Denmark by Icelandic parents and in 2014, he decided to quit his corporate job to satisfy his desire for adventure.<br /><br />Confronted with the unexpected realities of 2020, Gunnar audited his online presence and made a plan for adaptation. The end result is his newly redesigned website, which expands his online presence from a straightforward portfolio and print shop to a scalable digital infrastructure for long term success.<br /><br />The website itself is designed to seamlessly weave together Gunnar’s personal tone, style and love of his country in a usable and beautiful experience.",
